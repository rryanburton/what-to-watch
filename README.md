# What to Watch
A Movie Recommendation Solution
## Description
Use what_to_watch.py to see what other people thought of movies.
That's basically it.
You are seeing ratings that other people submitted about movies.

You should be able to:
* Find all ratings for a movie by id
* Find the average rating for a movie by id
* Find the name of a movie by id
* Find all ratings for a user

## Data Files
you should put your ml-100k data folder in the same folder as your app.
for example the path would look something like this: ml-100k/datafile.fl

First, go to the [MovieLens website](http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/)
and download the MovieLens 100K data. Unzip it and read the `README` file
to understand the data.
